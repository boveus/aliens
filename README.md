This is a rails project to use a CSV containing UFO sightings to do some analysis using active record.  It may expand to use other datasets to form correlations in the future. This is a project that I am using to practice my rails and active record skills.  I am also hoping to include some charts.js stuff in here and possibly hook into the google maps API.  If you are a fellow aspiring rails dev, please feel free to drop me a DM or PR if you are interested in joining me in this learning experience.  The dataset I will be analyzing comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings.
