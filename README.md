This is a project that I am using to practice my rails and active record skills.  I am also hoping to include some charts.js stuff in here and possibly hook into the google maps API.  If you are a fellow aspiring rails dev, please feel free to drop me a DM or PR if you are interested in joining me in this learning experience.
